<h3 id="sniffing">Sniffing basics</h3>

<p>
Sniffing is done through the <code>Sniffer</code> class. This class accepts
a <i>libpcap</i> string filter, and lets you sniff a certain interface, 
interpreting the packets sent through it, and giving you<code>PDU</code> 
objects so you can easily work with them.
</p>

<p>
Once you've set the filter, there are two functions which allow to 
retrieve the sniffed packets. One of them is <code>Sniffer::next_packet</code>.
This member function lets you retrieve a packet using the provided 
filter:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
// We want to sniff on eth0, and capture packets of at most 1000 bytes.
Sniffer sniffer("eth0", 1000);
// Only retrieve IP datagrams which are sent from 192.168.0.1
sniffer.set_filter("ip src 192.168.0.1");
// Retrieve the packet.
PDU *some_pdu = sniffer.next_packet();
// Do something with some_pdu...
....
// Delete it.
delete some_pdu;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Note that the third parameter in <code>Sniffer</code>'s constructor indicates 
whether you want to set the interface in monitor mode. By default 
it <b>is not</b>, so you'll only be able to sniff packets that are sent 
to or by you.
</p>

<h3 id="loop-sniffing">Loop sniffing</h3>

<p>
Though this is a valid way of retrieving packets, it's very common
that you want to sniff lots packets until some certain condition
is met. In that case its better to use <code>Sniffer::sniff_loop</code>.
</p>

<p>
This method takes a template functor as an argument, which must 
define an operator with one of the following signatures:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
bool operator()(PDU&);
bool operator()(const PDU&);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The call to <code>Sniffer::sniff_loop</code> will make the sniffer start 
processing packets. The functor will be called using each processed 
packet as its argument. If at some point, you want to stop sniffing, 
then your functor should return <code>false</code>. Otherwise return 
<code>true</code> and the <code>Sniffer</code> object will keep looping.
</p>

<p>
The functor object will be copy constructed, so it must implement copy
semantics. There is a helper template function which takes a pointer
to an object of a template parameter type, and a member function, 
and returns a <code>HandlerProxy</code>. That object implements the 
required operator, in which it forwards the call to the member function pointer
provided, using the object pointer given:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <tins/tins.h>

using namespace Tins;

bool doo(PDU&) {
    return false;
}

struct foo {
    void bar() {
        Sniffer sniffer("eth0", 1000, true, "ip src 192.168.0.100");
        /* Uses the helper function to create a proxy object that
         * will call this->handle. If you're using boost or C++11,
         * you could use boost::bind or std::bind, that will also
         * work.
         */
        sniffer.sniff_loop(make_sniffer_handler(this, &foo::handle));
        // Also valid
        sniffer.sniff_loop(doo);
    }
    
    bool handle(PDU&) {
        // Don't process anything
        return false;
    }
};

int main() {
    foo f;
    f.bar();
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
As you can see, the sniff_loop can not only be an easy way to process
several packets, but also can make your code tidier when using classes.
</p>
<p>
Now the interesting part. In the above example we know we are sniffing
<code>IP PDU</code>s sent by the ip address <i>192.168.0.100</i>, but our
function takes a <code>PDU&amp;</code>. We want to search the <code>IP PDU</code> 
stored inside the parameter(which will probably be of type <code>EthernetII</code>). 
Luckily for us, you can ask a <code>PDU</code> to search for a certain 
<code>PDU</code> type inside its whole stack of <i>PDU</i>s(including 
itself), and return a reference to it. If no such <code>PDU</code> is 
found in the packet, a <code>pdu_not_found</code> exception is thrown:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
bool doo(PDU &some_pdu) {
    // Search for it. If there is no IP PDU in the packet, 
    // the loop goes on
    const IP &ip = some_pdu.rfind_pdu<IP>(); // non-const works as well
    std::cout << "Destination address: " << ip->dst_addr() << std::endl;
    // Just one packet please
    return false;
}

void test() {
    Sniffer sniffer("eth0", 1000, true, "ip src 192.168.0.100");
    sniffer.sniff_loop(doo);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Another thing that makes the loop-sniffing mechanism better 
than fetching packets one by one, is exception handling. 
<code>Sniffer::sniff_loop</code> catches both <code>pdu_not_found</code> and
<code>malformed_packet</code> exceptions thrown in the functor body. This 
means you can use <code>PDU::rfind_pdu</code> and don't even care if such 
<code>PDU</code> is not found, since the exception will be caught by 
the <code>Sniffer</code>, and the sniffing session will continue. 
</p>

<h3 id="iterator-sniffing">Sniffing using iterators</h3>

<p>
There is yet another way to retrieve packets from a Sniffer object. 
This class defines two methods, <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code>, which
return forward iterators. These can be used to retrieve packets while
they're being sniffed:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
Sniffer s = ...;
for(auto &pdu : s) {
    // pdu is a PDU&
    process(pdu);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="packet-objects">Packet objects</h3>

<p>
If you require to store a <code>PDU</code> along with the timestamp object, 
then you should use the <code>Packet</code> class. <code>Packet</code>s 
contain a <code>PDU</code> and <code>Timestamp</code>, can be copyed and moved. 
</p>
<p>
Let's see an example in which we'll store 10 packets read from wire 
into a vector:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <vector>
#include <tins/tins.h>

using namespace Tins;

int main() {
    std::vector<Packet> vt;
    
    Sniffer sniffer("eth0", 1500);
    while(vt.size() != 10)
        // next_packet returns a PtrPacket, which can be implicitly 
        // converted to Packet.
        vt.push_back(sniffer.next_packet());
    // Done, now let's check the packets
    for(const auto& packet : vt) {
        // Is there an IP PDU somewhere?
        if(packet.pdu()->find_pdu<IP>()) {
            // Just print timestamp's seconds and IP source address
            std::cout << "At: " << packet.timestamp().seconds()
                    << " - " << packet.pdu()->find_pdu<IP>()->src_addr() 
                    << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
As you may have noticed <code>Packet</code> objects can also be used along
with <code>Sniffer::next_packet</code>:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
Sniffer sniffer("eth0", 1500);
// PDU pointer, as mentioned at the beginning
std::unique_ptr<PDU> pdu_ptr(sniffer.next_packet());

// auto cleanup, no need to use pointers!
Packet packet = sniffer.next_packet();
// If there was some kind of error, packet.pdu() == nullptr,
// so we need to check that.
if(packet)
    process_packet(packet); // whatever
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="read-pcap">Reading pcap files</h3>

<p>
Reading files in <i>pcap</i> format is very straightforward. The 
<code>FileSniffer</code> class takes the name of the file to be opened as 
argument, and lets you process the packets in it. Both <code>Sniffer</code>
and <code>FileSniffer</code> inherit from <code>BaseSniffer</code>, which is
the class that actually implements <code>next_pdu</code> and <code>sniff_loop</code>.
Therefore, we can use the <code>FileSniffer</code> class in the same way
we used <code>Sniffer</code> in the examples above:
</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
#include <tins/tins.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <stddef.h>

using namespace Tins;

size_t counter(0);

bool count_packets(PDU &) {
    counter++;
    // Always keep looping. When the end of the file is found, 
    // our callback will simply not be called again.
    return true;
}

int main() {
    FileSniffer sniffer("/tmp/some_pcap_file.pcap");
    sniffer.sniff_loop(count_packets);
    std::cout << "There are " << counter << " packets in the pcap filen";
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="interpretation">Packet interpretation</h3>

<p>
Now that we've seen the ways in which you can read pcap files and sniff 
from network interfaces, we'll have a look at how packet interpretation 
is performed.
</p>

<p>
Every time a packet is read from one of those sources, an object of that 
source's link layer type is created(<code>EthernetII</code>, <code>RadioTap</code>, 
etc). Each of these types of object detects which is the type of the next 
<code>PDU</code> based on its internal flags, creates it, adds it as its 
child, and propagates the same action.
</p>

<p>
This action is performed by every instantiated <code>PDU</code>, except for 
transport-layer protocols. This means that, for example, if a <code>DNS</code>
packet is sniffed off an ethernet interface, you'll get the following
structure:
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<div class="panel panel-default shrinked">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/DNS.png" alt="DNS" />
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        A <i>DNS</i> packet, as interpreted by <i>libtins</i>.
    </div>
</div>
</div>
<br />

<p>
You can then interpret that <code>DNS</code> packet constructing a <code>DNS</code>
object using that <code>RawPDU</code>'s payload:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
// This is a handler used in Sniffer::sniff_loop
bool handler(const PDU& pkt) {
    // Lookup the UDP PDU
    const UDP &udp = pkt.rfind_pdu<UDP>();
    // We need source/destination port to be 53
    if(udp.sport() == 53 || udp.dport() == 53) {
        // Interpret it as DNS. This might throw, but Sniffer catches it
        DNS dns = pkt.rfind_pdu<RawPDU>().to<DNS>();
        // Just print out each query's domain name
        for(const auto &query : dns.queries())
            std::cout << query.dname() << std::endl;
    }
    return true;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The same mechanism should be used for other protocols such as <code>DHCP</code>.
In case you're wondering why application-layer protocols aren't interpreted 
automatically by transport-layer <code>PDU</code>s, the reason is efficiency.
Transport layer protocols, such as <code>DNS</code>, require much more processing
in order to parse them than lower layer protocols. In addition, some 
applications might not even require to use those protocols, so making them
pay for that extra processing is undesirable.
