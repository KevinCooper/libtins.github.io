<h3>ARP Spoofing</h3>

<p>
This is a simple implementation of an <i>ARP</i> spoofing attack. This
implementation can spoof only one host's hardware address. You must 
provide the gateway and the host's <i>IP</i> address as command line
arguments.
</p>
<p>
In this example you can have a look at how the <i>EthernetII PDU</i> 
is used, and how hardware addresses are resolved in practice.
