title: C++ packet sniffing and crafting library

<p>
    <i>libtins</i> is a high-level, multiplatform <i>C++</i> network 
    packet sniffing and crafting library.
</p>
<p>
    Its main purpose is to provide the <i>C++</i> developer an easy,
    efficient, platform and endianess-independent way to create tools 
    which need to send, receive and manipulate network packets.
</p>
<p>
    The library is very simple to use. As a short example, this is 
    how it could be used to print the source and destination addresses 
    and ports of every <i>TCP</i> packet captured in the <i>eth0</i> 
    interface:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <iostream>
#include <tins/tins.h>

using namespace Tins;

bool handler(const PDU &pdu) {
    const IP &ip = pdu.rfind_pdu<IP>();
    const TCP &tcp = pdu.rfind_pdu<TCP>();
    std::cout << ip.src_addr() << ':' << tcp.sport() << " -> " 
              << ip.dst_addr() << ':' << tcp.dport() << std::endl;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    Sniffer("eth0").sniff_loop(handler);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    <i>libtins</i> was designed keeping efficiency in mind at all times.
    In fact, it is one of the fastest packet sniffing and interpretation 
    libraries available. The <a href="{{ site.url }}/benchmark/">benchmark</a> section 
    contains some actual measurements of how fast it works.
</p>
<p>
    Almost as much time was invested testing the library than 
    developing it. At the moment of writing, there are 607 unit tests, 
    which check that every getter, setter and method does what's 
    expected. All of them run successfully on Windows, OSX and both 
    little and big endian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.
