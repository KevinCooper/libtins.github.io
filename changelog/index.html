<h4 id="v1.2">Version 1.2</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Added BaseSniffer::begin and BaseSniffer::end.</li>
    <li>BaseSniffer::next_packet uses pcap_loop instead of pcap_next, which
doesn't work well on some linux distributions.</li>
    <li>Added PPI PDU class.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in EthernetII triggered when the size of the whole frame 
was lower than 60 bytes.</li>
    <li>Added AddressRange class and IPv4Address, IPv6Address and 
HWAddress&lt;&gt;::operator/.</li>
    <li>Added is_broadcast, is_multicast and is_unicast to IPv4, IPv6
and HWAddress.</li>
    <li>Added is_private and is_loopback methods to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</li>
    <li>Done some optimizations on TCP's constructor from buffer.</li>
    <li>Added helper functions to Dot11Data to retrieve the source, 
destination and BSSID addresses.</li>
    <li>Fixed bugs in DNS triggered when parsing MX and unknown records.</li>
    <li>BaseSniffer::next_packet now iterates until a valid packet is found.</li>
    <li>TCP::get_flag is now const.</li>
    <li>The --disable-wpa2 now works as expected.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="v1.1">Version 1.1</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented std::hash specialization for IPv4, IPv6 and HWAddress&lt;&gt;
types.</li>
    <li>Added a RSNHandshakeCapturer class.</li>
    <li>Added WPA2Decrypter class.</li>
    <li>IEEE 802.11 frames are not parsed if the RadioTap FAILED_FCS flag 
is on.</li>
    <li>RadioTap now calculates its size everytime it's serialized.</li>
    <li>Splitted the dot11.h and dot11.cpp files into several files to
speed up compilation times.</li>
    <li>Added HWAddress<>::is_broadcast and HWAddress::operator[].</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug triggered when parsing Dot11QoSData frames.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="v1.0">Version 1.0</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Link layer protocol PDUs now don't hold a NetworkInterface. This led
    to changes in their constructors.</li>
    <li>Removed the obsolete PDU* parameter taken by several classes' 
    constructors.</li>
    <li>IP now sets the sender's address automatically when no link layer
    PDU is used.</li>
    <li>IP, TCP and UDP now calculate the checksum everytime they're 
    serialized.</li>
    <li>Added PDU::rfind_pdu.</li>
    <li>Defined several exception types.</li>
    <li>Implemented matches_response on several protocols.</li>
    <li>PacketSender is now movable.</li>
    <li>Added an overload of add_option that takes an rvalue-reference in IP, 
    TCP, DHCP, ICMPv6 and Dot11.</li>
    <li>Added support for GNU/kFreeBSD.</li>
    <li>Removed several deprecated methods, such as PDU::clone_packet.
    <li>Added PacketSender::send(PDU&, NetworkInterface).</li>
    <li>Normalized the TLV options naming conventions in all of the classes
    that used them.</li>
    <li>Added support for Dot1Q, STP, PPPoE protocols.</li>
    <li>Made some important optimizations on PDUOption<>'s constructors.</li>
    <li>Added Utils::resolve_domain and Utils::resolve_domain6.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="v0.3">Version 0.3</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The IPv6, ICMPv6 and DHCPv6 protocols are now supported.</li>
    <li>Added support for Loopback interfaces and the Linux Crooked 
    Capture pseudo protocol.</li>
    <li>AAAA records are now correctly handled in DNS.</li>
    <li>Added Packet/RefPacket class. This classes allow reading the
    timestamp provided by libpcap, which is associated with each packet
    read from the wire or file.</li>
    <li>The library now works on FreeBSD, OSX and Windows, appart from
    the already supported GNU/Linux platform.</li>
    <li>C++11 move constructors/assignment operators have been added to
    every class that required one. This is extremely useful when working 
    with non-copyable classes such as Sniffer or PacketWriter.</li>
    <li>A complete rewrite of the build system was performed, which now
    uses libtool.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="v0.2">Version 0.2</h4>
<ul>
    <li>IP and hardware addresses can now be handled easily. Instead of 
    using pointers or integral values to represent them, there's now a 
    class which abstract each of them, making it easy to create them from 
    their string representations, and compare them. You can now use 
    hardware addresses as keys inside std::maps, or insert them in 
    std::sets.</li>
    <li>Added support for big endian architectures. We've worked hard to 
    make sure every getter, setter and function available handles endianness 
    correctly. Now you can create tools and run them on both little and big 
    endian architectures, without worrying about it.</li>
    <li>Generalized and simplified some interfaces. The Sniffer class 
    required you to inherit a class from an AbstractSnifferHandler just 
    to perform a call to Sniffer::sniff_loop. Now this function takes a 
    template functor argument and calls it every time a new packet is 
    sniffed off the wire, making your life a lot easier.</li>
    <li>Network interfaces used to be handled internally by each PDU. 
    Classes would usually take a std::string, look up the corresponding 
    interface index and store it, and also provide overloads that took 
    directly the integral index. Now there's a NetworkInterface class 
    which does this job internally. So PDUs now take objects of this type 
    rather than providing several overloads(which in cases like the Dot11 
    class hierarchy, reduces the boilerplate code significantly).</li>
    <li>You can now follow TCP streams on the fly. There's a 
    TCPStreamFollower class that sniffs packets(either from a network 
    interface or a pcap file), and reassembles TCP streams, executing a 
    callback whenever there's data available.</li>
    <li>We're planning to allow decrypting any 802.11 encrypted data frame 
    on the fly. In this release, by providing tuples (bssid, password), 
    you can decrypt WEP-encrypted frames while sniffing, in a completely 
    transparent way. I'll soon add an example in the libtins website on 
    how to do that.</li>
    <li>We've added support for some new PDUs: Null/Loopback, IEEE 802.3, 
    LLC and DNS.</li>
    <li>You can now read and write pcap files, using a very simple 
    interface. </li>
    <li>Finally, there's been a huge refactoring on the entire code. Code 
    has been RAII'd a lot. There are less pointers moving around, more 
    automatic storage objects and references. </li>
</ul>
