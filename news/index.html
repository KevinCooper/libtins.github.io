    <b>April 23th, 2013</b>: libtins v1.0 has been released! There have
    been some changes in some functions in the API, so some code might
    no longer compile(especially code that sent link-layer <i>PDU</i>s). 
    There won't be any modifications in the existing functions that break 
    your code in the near future, so don't worry. <br />
